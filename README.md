## Hi !!!
I am a Biologist from the University of Antioquia and I obtained my master degree in the same univesity. In the last eigth years, I have been working with the aquatic ecosystems of the north of the Andes. Freshwater systems are particularly interesting to me because they represent a minimal surface of the planet where ecological and evolutionary processes have taken place, giving rise to great to great diversity in species and interactions. During my undergraduate studies, I worked with fish community ecology, and in my master’s studies I researched populations genetics and phylogeography. As a PhD student of INECOL, I’m mainly interested in understanding how some morphological and ecological traits of freshwater fish species have influenced their diversification on a global scale.
